    title: "Campaign: No to Manusmruti, Yes to Sanvidhan",
    description:
      "Manusmruti Nako, Sanvidhan Have\n Our country has a Constitution that advocates for a socialist, secular, democratic, sovereign nation and values of equality, justice, freedom, Maitri for all its citizens.  While this has been the political vision of the Constitution makers led by Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar, our social reality has been governed for ages by a Brahminical Patriarchy as encompassed most comprehensively in the Manusmruti and practised for centuries in different forms. There have been continuous challenges to this ideology and the adoption of the Constitution was one such major victory. \n\nThe framework of Constitutional values helped the many ongoing struggles for social transformation. The feminist struggles are one such attempt at transformatory challenge to Patriarchies in society. In the last few years we have seen state power move into the hands of forces that hark back to oppressive values under the garb of claiming tradition and culture. So we have an upsurge of practices and policies that seem to emanate from the regressive Manusmruti. Hence in tracking back the history of the feminist movements in Maharashtra one of the major campaigns that we have undertaken is “Manusmruti Nako, Sanvidhan Have”.\n\nAs part of the campaign the attempt is to demonstrate to activists and people at large that :\n    • While we may not have all read the Manusmruti it lingers in our culture and traditions in more ways than one. \n    • That many of our struggles have been against Brahminical patriarchy as we are all affected by caste, gender, religion and class.\n    • How in the last few years the State policies have become more governed by what seems like ideology of the Manusmruti \n    • How it is not enough to say that we belive in the Constitution but it is equally important to actively recognise and reject the legacy of codes like the Manusmruti.\n    • That this is a long struggle of many centuries and we are part of this resistance.\n\nActions of the campaign: \n1. We conduct workshops and discussions on the above. We have had many such workshops, meetings, discussions in Mumbai, Marathawada, Konkan, Vidarbha regions. \n2. We are attempting to create a network of organisations and individuals who can align with each other to make sure that hate speech and targeted violence along lines of caste, religion and gender is addressed using the Constitutional mechanisms. \n3. We are also doing this with programs that communicate messages of non violence, love and peace like peace marches, film screenings, music sessions, food festivals etc.",

      'Violence against women in Indian society is escalating daily, manifesting in increasingly brutal forms both within and outside the home, including workplaces. Harassment and torture are also prevalent in public spaces such as markets, roads, buses, railways, ST stands, and schools.\n\nWith a growing number of women commuting for employment, education, and household tasks, public transportation is being utilized extensively. To ensure the safety of women and girls in these public spaces, it\'s crucial to identify specific issues and assess existing facilities and safety measures. Therefore, a "Safety Audit" initiative has been launched in Maharashtra to evaluate the safety of locations like ST stands, railway stations, and local bus depots.\n\nActions of the campaign -\nA questionnaire has been developed and finalized after an initial audit in Pune. \nSurvey volunteers receive comprehensive training and guidance. \nData is collected by visiting each location twice, once during the day and once at night, to ensure thorough information gathering.\nThe information gathered from this questionnaire will inform demands made to the government, and a detailed report will be published. \nThis safety audit recognizes that public safety for women is not merely about formal plans and measures; it is an integral part of their constitutional rights, and the audit is being conducted from this fundamental perspective.\n',

    title: "Zabardasti Me Kaisi Mardangi?",
    description:
      "The concept of 'coercive masculinity' originated from an elderly villager who observed young men using religion to justify violence and aggression. They leveraged their masculine power to perpetuate abusive and discriminatory behaviors. It became clear that, similar to how masculinity itself isn't the problem but rather its distorted and forced expression, Hinduism isn't inherently problematic. Instead, the core issue lies in the manipulation of Hinduism to incite hatred against other communities and compel compliance.\n\nThus, the 'Forced Masculinity' campaign was born. This initiative calls for accountability from both the government and society. It addresses a wide range of issues, from \"love jihad\" and road rage to cybercrime, Dalit atrocities, and violence against women. We have developed various media tools to launch this campaign and foster dialogue among young people, transgender individuals, and women.\n",

    description:
      "Manusmruti Nako, Sanvidhan Have\n Our country has a Constitution that advocates for a socialist, secular, democratic, sovereign nation and values of equality, justice, freedom, Maitri for all its citizens.  While this has been the political vision of the Constitution makers led by Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar, our social reality has been governed for ages by a Brahminical Patriarchy as encompassed most comprehensively in the Manusmruti and practised for centuries in different forms. There have been continuous challenges to this ideology and the adoption of the Constitution was one such major victory. \n\nThe framework of Constitutional values helped the many ongoing struggles for social transformation. The feminist struggles are one such attempt at transformatory challenge to Patriarchies in society. In the last few years we have seen state power move into the hands of forces that hark back to oppressive values under the garb of claiming tradition and culture. So we have an upsurge of practices and policies that seem to emanate from the regressive Manusmruti. Hence in tracking back the history of the feminist movements in Maharashtra one of the major campaigns that we have undertaken is “Manusmruti Nako, Sanvidhan Have”.\n\nAs part of the campaign the attempt is to demonstrate to activists and people at large that :\n    • While we may not have all read the Manusmruti it lingers in our culture and traditions in more ways than one. \n    • That many of our struggles have been against Brahminical patriarchy as we are all affected by caste, gender, religion and class.\n    • How in the last few years the State policies have become more governed by what seems like ideology of the Manusmruti \n    • How it is not enough to say that we belive in the Constitution but it is equally important to actively recognise and reject the legacy of codes like the Manusmruti.\n    • That this is a long struggle of many centuries and we are part of this resistance.\n\nActions of the campaign: \n1. We conduct workshops and discussions on the above. We have had many such workshops, meetings, discussions in Mumbai, Marathawada, Konkan, Vidarbha regions. \n2. We are attempting to create a network of organisations and individuals who can align with each other to make sure that hate speech and targeted violence along lines of caste, religion and gender is addressed using the Constitutional mechanisms. \n3. We are also doing this with programs that communicate messages of non violence, love and peace like peace marches, film screenings, music sessions, food festivals etc.",

    title: "Safety Audit of Public Transport Spaces",
    description:
      'Violence against women in Indian society is escalating daily, manifesting in increasingly brutal forms both within and outside the home, including workplaces. Harassment and torture are also prevalent in public spaces such as markets, roads, buses, railways, ST stands, and schools.\n\nWith a growing number of women commuting for employment, education, and household tasks, public transportation is being utilized extensively. To ensure the safety of women and girls in these public spaces, it\'s crucial to identify specific issues and assess existing facilities and safety measures. Therefore, a "Safety Audit" initiative has been launched in Maharashtra to evaluate the safety of locations like ST stands, railway stations, and local bus depots.\n\nActions of the campaign -\nA questionnaire has been developed and finalized after an initial audit in Pune. \nSurvey volunteers receive comprehensive training and guidance. \nData is collected by visiting each location twice, once during the day and once at night, to ensure thorough information gathering.\nThe information gathered from this questionnaire will inform demands made to the government, and a detailed report will be published. \nThis safety audit recognizes that public safety for women is not merely about formal plans and measures; it is an integral part of their constitutional rights, and the audit is being conducted from this fundamental perspective.\n',

    title: "Zabardasti Me Kaisi Mardangi?",
    description:
      "The concept of 'coercive masculinity' originated from an elderly villager who observed young men using religion to justify violence and aggression. They leveraged their masculine power to perpetuate abusive and discriminatory behaviors. It became clear that, similar to how masculinity itself isn't the problem but rather its distorted and forced expression, Hinduism isn't inherently problematic. Instead, the core issue lies in the manipulation of Hinduism to incite hatred against other communities and compel compliance.\n\nThus, the 'Forced Masculinity' campaign was born. This initiative calls for accountability from both the government and society. It addresses a wide range of issues, from \"love jihad\" and road rage to cybercrime, Dalit atrocities, and violence against women. We have developed various media tools to launch this campaign and foster dialogue among young people, transgender individuals, and women.\n",
